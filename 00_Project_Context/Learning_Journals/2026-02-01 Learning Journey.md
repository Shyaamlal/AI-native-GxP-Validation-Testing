# Learning Journey - 2026-02-01

## Where I Left Off (Jan 31)
- Was investigating Sambhava bugs (MP3, corrupted WAV, short audio)
- Got overwhelmed deciding between testing-first vs implementation-first
- Realized I was being reactive (chasing bugs) instead of systematic

## Decision for Today
**Chose Option C: Map Admin Login Workflow**

Why: Need foundational understanding before bug-fixing. This gives me:
- End-to-end exposure (UI → code → testing)
- Systematic approach vs reactive bug-chasing
- Foundation for all future work

## Plan for Today
1. Find which file contains admin login page
2. Map the login workflow from UI to code
3. Understand: What happens when admin clicks "Sign In"?
4. Document in technical note

## Questions for This Session
- How do I read unfamiliar code to understand workflows?
- What's the connection between UI components and backend logic?
- Where should tests go for this workflow?
