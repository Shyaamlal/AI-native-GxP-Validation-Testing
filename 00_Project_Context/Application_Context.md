- No rate limiting
- Session stored in browser localStorage (client-controlled)
- No route protection at code level

**Risk Context:**
- Appropriate for demo/learning environment
- Not production-ready security model
- Would require significant changes for real deployment

**❓ UNKNOWN:**
- Backend security measures (if backend exists)
- Data encryption (at rest, in transit)
- API authentication (if APIs exist)
- Audit logging

---

## Risk Assessment Context

### Critical Features (Business Impact)

**✅ VERIFIED (from PRD):**

**Most Critical Feature:** Audio upload and processing

**Rationale:**
- Core value proposition of entire application
- Without working audio processing, no assessments can be generated
- All other features (security, data management, reporting) support this primary function
- System failure = complete business impact (cannot deliver service)

**Priority for Validation:**
1. **Audio upload and processing** (Critical - core business function)
2. **Assessment results generation** (Critical - delivers value)
3. **Client data management** (High - required for workflow)
4. **Report generation/export** (High - delivers results to clients)
5. **Admin authentication** (Medium - enables access but not core value)

---

### Sensitive Data & Compliance

**✅ VERIFIED (from PRD):**

**Primary Concern - Personal Information (PII):**
- Client name
- Date of birth
- Gender
- **Risk Level:** High - persistent data that identifies individuals
- **Compliance requirement:** GDPR/data protection applicable

**Secondary Concern - Voice Recordings:**
- **Data type:** Biometric data
- **Risk Level:** Medium - sensitive, but ephemeral
- **Current handling:** Deleted after each session (temporary storage only)
- **Rationale:** Voice is biometric but transient processing reduces risk

**Tertiary Concern - Assessment Results:**
- **Risk Level:** Low-Medium without PII context
- **Nature:** Abstract scores and recommendations
- **Impact:** Could affect employment decisions

**Compliance Focus:**
- PII protection (primary)
- Data retention policies
- Access control (who can view client data)
- Right to deletion (GDPR Article 17)
- Data minimization

---

### Known Limitations

**✅ VERIFIED (from Login validation):**
- Single admin account only (hardcoded credentials)
- No password management capability
- No multi-factor authentication
- Client-side authentication (security limitation)
- No session timeout (indefinite sessions)
- Credentials exposed in error messages

**✅ VERIFIED (from PRD):**
- No client login capability (currently)
- Admin manages all client data and interactions
- Voice recordings deleted after processing (cannot be retrieved later)

**❓ UNKNOWN - From PRD Knowledge Gaps:**
- Client PII retention period not defined

- Three-layer verification catches AI errors effectively

**Applicable to future features:**
- Feature boundary decisions require explicit rationale
- Investigation verification essential for retrospective validation
- Test case traceability must be bidirectional

---

## Context Expansion Strategy

This document grows incrementally as features are validated:

### When Validating a New Feature:

1. **Before validation:** Review this context for relevant information
2. **During investigation:** Document new findings here
3. **After validation:** Update with verified facts, patterns, and lessons
4. **Mark knowledge quality:** Use ✅ VERIFIED, 👁️ OBSERVED, 🤔 ASSUMED, ❓ UNKNOWN

### What Gets Added:

- ✅ Technical implementation details (from code investigation)
- ✅ Business rules discovered (from behavior observation)
- ✅ Data model expansions (from feature analysis)
- ✅ Integration points found (from code or testing)
- ✅ Risk insights (from validation work)

### What Stays Out:

- ❌ Feature-specific test cases (belong in feature folders)
- ❌ Validation status tracking (belongs in Validation_Status_Dashboard)
- ❌ Traceability matrices (belong in Traceability_Matrix.xlsx)
- ❌ Temporary validation notes (belong in thread summaries)

---

## Using This Context

### For AI-Assisted Validation:

**Load this file at session start:**
```
Read 00_Project_Context/Sambhava_Application_Context.md for application knowledge.
```

**AI tools will:**
- Generate Sambhava-specific requirements (not generic templates)
- Consider known business rules and data models
- Reference established patterns and decisions
- Ask relevant clarifying questions
- Respect validated feature boundaries

**Without this context:**
- AI produces generic validation documents
- Misses application-specific risks
- Can't maintain consistency across features
- Requires repeating context every session

---

## Document Maintenance

**Update triggers:**
- After completing any feature validation
- When discovering new application facts (during investigation)
- When business rules are clarified (by human input)
- When architectural decisions are documented

**Update responsibility:**
- Validation engineer adds verified findings
- AI tool suggests updates at session end
- Human approves and commits changes

**Quality over completeness:**
- Better to mark ❓ UNKNOWN than make unjustified assumptions
- Update incrementally, don't try to document everything upfront
- Verify before marking ✅ VERIFIED

---

## Open Questions for Next Investigation

### High Priority (Needed for Next Features):

1. **Data models:** What are the complete Client and Assessment schemas?
2. **Backend:** Does a backend exist? What does it handle?
3. **Business rules:** What validation rules govern client and assessment data?
4. **Workflows:** What are the complete admin and client workflows?

### Medium Priority (Useful context):

5. **Integration:** What external services are used (email, storage, AI)?
6. **Authorization:** How is access control implemented beyond authentication?
7. **Reporting:** How are assessment reports generated and delivered?

### Low Priority (Can be deferred):

8. **Deployment:** Production environment and infrastructure
9. **Performance:** Known performance characteristics and limitations
10. **History:** Why were specific technical decisions made?
