# Session Starter Template

**Purpose:** Use this to start a new thread and continue work with full context loaded.

## Copy-Paste This Into New Thread
```
Continuing AI-native validation portfolio work.

**Working Directory:** C:\Users\motic\sambhava-validation-portfolio

**LOAD CONTEXT:**
Read ALL files in 00_Project_Context/ to understand:
- Methodology.md (validation approach - retrospective + greenfield)
- README.md (context management and workflow)
- Thread_Summaries/ (check latest file for previous session details)

**CURRENT STATUS:**
✅ Repository structure created
✅ Git initialized and configured  
✅ Main README.md complete (contributor positioning)
✅ Project Context README complete (practical workflow)
✅ Methodology.md complete (10-step validation workflow)
✅ Login validation package complete (8 files from Obsidian)

**PENDING - Priority Order:**
1. Sambhava_Application_Context.md (30-40 min) ← START HERE
2. Master_Validation_Plan.md (15 min)
3. Validation_Status_Dashboard.md (10 min)
4. Skills/feature_boundary_skill.md (10 min)
5. Traceability_Matrix.xlsx (15 min)

**TODAY'S GOAL:** Complete remaining context files, then push to GitHub.

**STARTING WITH:** Sambhava_Application_Context.md

This is the MOST IMPORTANT context file. It transforms AI from generic to Sambhava-specific.

Ready to create it? I'll need your input on:
- Business rules and workflows
- Risk context and criticality
- Known limitations and constraints

I can use Claude Code to investigate the codebase for technical details (architecture, data models, etc.), but I need your domain knowledge for business context.

Let's start!
