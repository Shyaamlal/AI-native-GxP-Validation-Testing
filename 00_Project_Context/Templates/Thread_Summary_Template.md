## Documentation Accuracy Checklist

**Before finalizing this thread summary, verify:**

- [ ] "What We Accomplished" describes what was ACTUALLY done (not just planned)
- [ ] Investigation findings cite actual verification reports (not just methodology)
- [ ] Status labels are accurate (Documentation Complete ≠ Validation Complete)
- [ ] Verification completeness is honestly assessed (commission vs omission)
- [ ] Decisions are documented with rationale (not just "we decided X")
- [ ] File statuses are current (don't claim complete if still draft)
- [ ] No aspirational claims without evidence (distinguish intent from execution)

**Common accuracy mistakes to avoid:**

❌ "Verification complete - 100% accurate"  
✅ "Verification: Commission checks passed (3/3), omission checks pending"

❌ "Feature validated"  
✅ "Feature documentation complete, test execution pending"

❌ "AI investigation was thorough"  
✅ "AI found 6 files, keyword search found 2, omission verification: medium confidence"
